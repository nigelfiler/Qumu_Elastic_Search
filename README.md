## Introduction

This connector provides a simple HTTP client to interact with Elasticsearch-compatible search services via the standard Elasticsearch REST API. It was originally developed for Bonsai and is integral to **Qumu Cloud**, our enterprise Video CMS for secure video management, distribution, and playback.

This connector powers indexing and search of video metadata such as Title, Description, Tags and Publisher. It can be expanded to include: Transcripts and analytics.

By abstracting core logic, you can swap out endpoint URLs, credentials, and version-specific behaviors with minimal changes, making it ideal for any Elasticsearch-compatible service.

## Features

- **Elasticsearch HTTP API** support (CRUD, search, bulk, scroll)
- **Version-aware** logic for Elasticsearch 7.x and 8.x compatibility
- **Provider-agnostic**: works with Bonsai, Elastic Cloud, AWS OpenSearch, and self-managed clusters
- **Pluggable authentication**: basic auth or API key out of the box
- **Configurable SSL/TLS verification** options



## Configuration

Configure the connector by setting environment variables or passing a config object:

| Variable                      | Description                                    | Example                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ES_HOST`                     | Endpoint URL for Elasticsearch-compatible host | `https://my-cluster.example.com:9243`   |
| `ES_API_KEY`                  | API key for authentication (preferred)         |                                         |
| `ES_USERNAME` / `ES_PASSWORD` | Basic auth credentials (less secure)           | `admin` / `P@ssw0rd!`                   |
| `ES_TLS_VERIFY`               | Enable/disable certificate verification        | `false` to skip self-signed cert checks |

## Authentication

This connector supports:

- **API Key** (recommended): set via `ES_API_KEY` header
- **Basic Authentication**: supply `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD`

> **Note:** Using basic passwords is inherently insecureâ€”avoid in production or ensure strong, rotated credentials.

## Security Considerations

- **Basic Passwords**: Transmitting credentials via HTTP Basic auth exposes usernames and passwords in headers; always use HTTPS and enforce TLS.
- **Credential Storage**: Do not hard-code credentials in source. Use secure vaults or environment variables.
- **Certificate Verification**: Disabling TLS verification (`ES_TLS_VERIFY=false`) exposes you to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff to handle throttling; avoid hard retries.
- **Least Privilege**: Create users with minimal permissions (e.g., index-level only).
