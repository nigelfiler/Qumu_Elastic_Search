# Qumu_Elastic_Search

..Introduction..

This connector provides a simple HTTP client to interact with Elasticsearch-compatible search services via the standard Elasticsearch REST API. It was originally developed for Bonsai and is integral to Qumu Cloud, our enterprise Video CMS for secure video management, distribution, and playback.

Within Qumu Cloud, this connector powers indexing and search of video metadata, transcript text, and analytics eventsâ€”enabling features such as:

Full-text transcript search across all video assets

Metadata-based filtering (e.g., tags, categories, custom fields)

Real-time analytics dashboards and reporting

By abstracting core logic, you can swap out endpoint URLs, credentials, and version-specific behaviors with minimal changes, making it ideal for any Elasticsearch-compatible service.
